👨‍💻 Project Overview:
Recently, I worked on a Python-based Cloud Kitchen Ordering System to practice coding logic and explore how simple automations can improve customer interactions. This project focuses on building a user-friendly menu system, handling orders dynamically, and applying discounts or delivery fees based on the total amount.

💡 Key Features of the System:

📝 Dynamic Menu Display: Users can browse menu items with their prices.
🛒 Interactive Ordering: Add items to the cart with quantity and get real-time updates.
🎉 Discounts: Automatically applies a 10% discount for orders above ₹500.
🚚 Delivery Charges: Adds a delivery fee for orders below ₹300.
🧾 Order Summary: Neatly displays itemized costs, subtotals, and the final amount.
🛡️ Error Handling: Ensures valid inputs for item names and quantities.
✨ What I Learned:

Handling user input effectively to make the system intuitive.
Using dictionaries for efficient cart and bill management.
Structuring code for better readability and reusability.
Enhancing user experience with clean and formatted outputs.
🤔 How This Can Be Used in Real Life:
This simple script can serve as the foundation for a small-scale cloud kitchen or restaurant ordering system. It highlights how automation can streamline operations and enhance customer satisfaction.
